Simple Circuit Simulation
Overview
This project is a basic web-based electrical circuit simulator.
It allows users to:

 - Toggle a switch to turn the circuit ON and OFF

 - Adjust the resistance using a slider

 - See the effects on a virtual lightbulb (brightness) and the calculated current based on Ohm’s Law

This project is designed to help beginners understand the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current in a simple, interactive way.

How It Works
 - Switch: Turns the circuit ON or OFF, lighting up the bulb when ON.

 - Resistance Slider: Changes the resistance value, affecting how bright the bulb glows and how much current flows.

 - Current Calculation: Uses Ohm’s Law (Current = Voltage / Resistance) to update and display the current in real-time.

Technologies Used
 - HTML

 - CSS

 - JavaScript

JavaScript Fundamentals Practiced
This project helped practice and strengthen the following JavaScript fundamentals:

 - Variables: Declaring and updating values (e.g., let voltage, let resistance)

 - Functions: Grouping code into reusable actions (toggleSwitch(), updateResistance(), calculateCurrent())

 - Conditionals: Using if...else statements to control what happens based on user actions

 - DOM Manipulation:

   * Accessing elements with document.getElementById

   * Changing attributes like src and innerText

   * Adding and removing CSS classes dynamically

   * Changing inline styles (style.filter)

 - Event Handling: Reacting to user actions like clicking a switch or moving a slider

 - Parsing and Math:

 * Converting string inputs to numbers (parseInt())

 * Performing simple calculations (Ohm’s Law: Voltage ÷ Resistance)

 * Using .toFixed(2) to limit numbers to two decimal places

Features
 * Visual ON/OFF switch

 * Dynamic resistance adjustment

 * Real-time current calculation

 * Bulb brightness changes according to resistance

 * Basic flow line animations when the circuit is active

How to Use
 * Open the webpage in your browser.

 * Toggle the switch to turn the circuit ON or OFF.

 * Move the slider to change the resistance and see how the bulb brightness and current change.

Learning Objectives:
 * Understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements

 * Applying basic programming concepts to real-world simulations

 * Strengthening knowledge of functions, events, conditionals, and DOM manipulation

 * Visualizing real-world electrical principles with simple code
